Demonstrates how a flex client can talk over SSL to multiple backend servers using a reverse proxy.

The project contains 4 modules
- A minimal flex client implemented with FLEX_SDK 4.6, built with maven 3.0.4
- 2 java applications implementing AMF channels using
-- Java 7
-- keytool-maven-plugin to create a self signed certificate and keystore
-- flex-messageing 4.5
-- Apach Tomcat 7
- a Nginx manager project that
-- downloads nginx for windows
-- creates a self signed certificate using openssl

INSTRUCTIONS:

git clone https://bytewood@www.bitbucket.org/bytewood/amf-example.git
cd amf-example
mvn clean package
run.bat

Doing the above will 
- open 2 terminal windows with tomcat running on port 8443 and 9443.
- run nginx
- run the flex client in your default browser.
- wait on the command line until a key is pressed, then stop nginx.
